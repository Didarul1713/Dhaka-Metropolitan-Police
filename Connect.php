        <p>
            I would like to extend my whole hearted and warmest congratulations to the citizens of our so beloved city Dhaka.

            We are striving to deliver a professional and responsive policing service to the citizens. Our strong commitment is to ensure protection of life and property and to keep the peace and tranquility in the city. A core function of our activities is to take all possible steps to prevent crime, to identify criminals responsible for crime and to bring them under the process of law. Some of the recent activities that DMP has introduced to achieve this include Beat Policing and Community Policing. These activities were implemented to ensure unity, integration and understanding between DMP and the citizens of the city. When people are hesitant in going to the police, we will go to their door step, to stand at their side, to help them in solving their problems. We want to win the trust and confidence of the people through our actions, work and conduct.

            Our dream is for an entirely crime free city but this is next to impossible as it is non existent to our known earth. We have constraints; despite our limitations in manpower, vehicles, equipment and logistics, our promise is to pursue all criminals to bring them to book and to attend all reports of crime promptly.

            It is our hope that citizens of Dhaka will embrace DMP and work with us in a partnership that will help in building Dhaka into a model city of peace & security.
        </p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px;font-family:Oswald"> About DMP</h1>
            Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) came into being on 1st February, 1976. Mr. E.A. Chowdhury the first Commissioner and Mr. A.S.M.Shahjahan (later on made IGP, Secretary and Advisor to the Caretaker Government) the first Deputy Commissioner (HQ) jointly
            toiled at setting-up an effective and professional Metropolitan Police. Afterwards, Mr. A.M. M. Aminur Rahman and Mr. A. R. Khandokar shouldered the responsibilities to shape this organization as dignified one. DMP started its course with 12 police
            stations along with 6000 forces in 1976. Population of Dhaka City stood to be less than 40, 00,000. Now the population is almost 1.5 cores. The Metropolitan area itself has increased in shape and size year after year. This increased population
            and area must of course, call for extended quality service. So modernization and improvement of DMP is a demand of time. This concept led to reshaping DMP in respect of force, size, modernization and organizational structure. The big step towards
            materializing this process is to establish 49 police stations instead of 12.This mega organization is functioning its assigned and voluntary tasks with a Commissioner, 5 Addl.Commissioners,9 Joint Commissioners,31 Deputy Commissioners (DC), 48
            Addl. Deputy Commissioners (ADC), 66 Senior Assistant Commissioners (Sr. AC), 123 Assistant Commissioners (AC), 453 Inspectors, 2907 Sub-Inspectors,Sergeants,Armed.Sub-Inspectors,Town Sub-Inspectors,3087 Assistant Sub-Inspectors(AB/UB). At present
            total strength of Dhaka Metropolitan Police personnel (all ranks and status) is more than 26,661( including ministrial staff ). DMP functions are divided into five operational Divisions with an Addl.Commissioner each in the command assisted by
            a band of Deputy Commissioners, Addl. Deputy Commissioners, and Assistant Commissions with their willingness and sagacious co-ordination. The prime responsibility of Detective and Criminal Intelligence Division is to detect sensational crimes
            and to be on the track of notorious criminals. Apprehension of criminal gangs and veteran criminals and recovery of illegal firearms and explosives are preoccupation of every DB officer,alert the prosecution of Detective and Criminal Intelligence
            Division works in connection with the procedure in the court. Crime and Operations Division is basically responsible for policing i.e. maintaining law and order situation in the concerned area. The jobs of apprehension of the criminals, warrant
            execution, investigation of the cases, recovery of illegal arms etc come naturally under the responsibility of this Division. Crime and Ops Division provides the service of prevention and detection of crime directly to the public through the police
            stations. Traffic Division plans, executes and controls the Metropolitan’s traffic system along with creating awareness for traffic rules in the pubic mind. Protection and Protocol Division includes the job of providing protection to the V.V.I.P
            s and V.I.P s including chancery to secure the diplomatic missions and surrounding area. Public Order Management and Headquarters Division nurtures a huge number of riot police and strengthens and consolidates the force of Crime and Ops Division
            in any emergency. This division provides logistic and administrative and other miscellaneous supports to the DMP as well.
