        Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) came into being on 1st February, 1976. Mr. E.A. Chowdhury the first Commissioner and Mr. A.S.M.Shahjahan (later on made IGP, Secretary and Advisor to the Caretaker Government) the first Deputy Commissioner (HQ) jointly
        toiled at setting-up an effective and professional Metropolitan Police. Afterwards, Mr. A.M. M. Aminur Rahman and Mr. A. R. Khandokar shouldered the responsibilities to shape this organization as dignified one. DMP started its course with 12 police
        stations along with 6000 forces in 1976. Population of Dhaka City stood to be less than 40, 00,000. Now the population is almost 1.5 cores. The Metropolitan area itself has increased in shape and size year after year. This increased population
        and area must of course, call for extended quality service. So modernization and improvement of DMP is a demand of time. This concept led to reshaping DMP in respect of force, size, modernization and organizational structure. The big step towards
        materializing this process is to establish 49 police stations instead of 12.This mega organization is functioning its assigned and voluntary tasks with a Commissioner, 5 Addl.Commissioners,9 Joint Commissioners,31 Deputy Commissioners (DC), 48
        Addl. Deputy Commissioners (ADC), 66 Senior Assistant Commissioners (Sr. AC), 123 Assistant Commissioners (AC), 453 Inspectors, 2907 Sub-Inspectors,Sergeants,Armed.Sub-Inspectors,Town Sub-Inspectors,3087 Assistant Sub-Inspectors(AB/UB). At present
        total strength of Dhaka Metropolitan Police personnel (all ranks and status) is more than 26,661( including ministrial staff ). DMP functions are divided into five operational Divisions with an Addl.Commissioner each in the command assisted by
        a band of Deputy Commissioners, Addl. Deputy Commissioners, and Assistant Commissions with their willingness and sagacious co-ordination. The prime responsibility of Detective and Criminal Intelligence Division is to detect sensational crimes
        and to be on the track of notorious criminals. Apprehension of criminal gangs and veteran criminals and recovery of illegal firearms and explosives are preoccupation of every DB officer,alert the prosecution of Detective and Criminal Intelligence
        Division works in connection with the procedure in the court. Crime and Operations Division is basically responsible for policing i.e. maintaining law and order situation in the concerned area. The jobs of apprehension of the criminals, warrant
